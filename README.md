# Random-Dot-Kinematogram
The Random Dot Kinematogram is quiet complicated to be implemented in the Presentation software. Here I have developed a script that can easily realiably achive it. 

The scene file has a complete code for 169 trials with defined timing. all the timing are availabe in the code and can be edited. but it is written in a functions that can be easily transported to somewhere else. The main code can be changed based on the experiment.

this code it is designed for EEG-fMRI study and the values for fMRI is availbe. also by activating the #scenario_type=fMRI_emulation you can run it in the lab. for EEG it sends the triggers and the information to the parallel port (LPT)

# Usage
Just add it to a experiment in the presentaon and run the experiment
